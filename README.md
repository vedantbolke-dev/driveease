## Project Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- MySQL Server (XAMPP or standalone)
- pip (Python package manager)

---

### Step 2: Extract the Project

```bash
cd driveease
```

---

### Step 3: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 4: Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Windows note:** If `mysqlclient` fails to build, either:
> - Install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/), OR
> - Replace `mysqlclient` with `PyMySQL` in requirements.txt and add to settings.py:
>   ```python
>   import pymysql; pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()
>   ```

---

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Windows
copy .env.example .env

# Mac/Linux
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your MySQL password:
```
DB_NAME=driveease_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

---

### Step 6: Create MySQL Database

Open MySQL / phpMyAdmin and run:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE driveease_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

---

### Step 7: Run Django Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations users cars bookings
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Step 8: Seed Sample Data

```bash
python manage.py seed_data
```

This creates:
- ✅ 9 sample cars (all categories)
- ✅ Admin user: `admin` / `Admin@1234`

---

### Step 9: Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open in browser: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**
